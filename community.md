# Community

This project is currently under development by members of the [Blue Button developer community](https://github.com/blue-button?tab=members).

## Contributing

There are a number of ways you can contribute to the library.

- Provide feedback on the JSON model (which is still improving)
- Expand the parsing or generation functionality (there's a lot more to the C-CDA spec than we cover)
- Add support for parsing CCRs (another legacy format)
